## Functionality Overview

Artha is designed to be a comprehensive co-pilot for entrepreneurs, from managing daily finances to planning long-term business strategy.

### 1. Core Financial Management

At its heart, Artha is a robust tool for tracking your financial health.

*   **Dashboard**: The central hub of your financial life. After logging in, you are greeted with a clear summary of your total income, total expenses, and savings rate. The dashboard also features an AI-generated "Fin Bite"—a personalized, actionable tip based on your recent financial activity.
*   **Transaction Management**: Manually add income and expense transactions with descriptions, dates, and amounts.
*   **AI-Powered Import**: Save time by using the AI import tool. Upload a financial document (like a PDF bank statement or a CSV file), and the app's AI will automatically parse the document, extract all transactions, and add them to your history.
*   **Budgeting**: Create monthly budgets for different spending categories (e.g., "Groceries," "Rent," "Marketing"). The app tracks your spending in real-time against these budgets and visualizes your progress, helping you stay on track.
*   **Goal Tracking**: Set and monitor financial goals. For individuals, this could be a "Savings Goal" like a down payment for a car. For MSMEs, this could be a "Development Goal" like funding a new marketing campaign. The dashboard tracks your available funds against the total target for all your goals.

### 2. AI-Powered Advisory & Brainstorming

Artha integrates AI to provide intelligent assistance beyond simple tracking.

*   **AI Financial Advisor**: A conversational chat interface where you can ask financial questions. The AI uses your recent transaction history as context to provide personalized, relevant advice. You can ask things like, "Where is most of my money going?" or "Suggest ways to reduce my monthly expenses."
*   **Business Idea Brainstorming**: This section is an idea generation powerhouse.
    *   **Curated Ideas**: Explore a library of pre-vetted startup ideas organized by category (e.g., AgriTech, Eco-Friendly).
    *   **AI Analysis**: Select a curated idea or enter your own custom business concept. The AI will generate a detailed, structured analysis covering:
        *   Investment Strategy
        *   Target Audience & Marketing
        *   Return on Investment (ROI) Projections
        *   Future-Proofing & Scalability
        *   Relevant Indian Government Schemes
    *   **Save & Manage Ideas**: Any idea you analyze is automatically saved to your "My Ideas" section for future reference.

### 3. Automated Detailed Project Report (DPR) Generation

This is one of the app's most powerful features, turning your business idea into a bank-ready document.

*   **Two-Stage AI Process**:
    1.  **Elaboration**: First, the AI takes your basic business idea and elaborates on it, creating a rich, detailed business profile. It creatively fills in details about the business model, target market, competitive landscape, and unique selling propositions (USPs).
    2.  **DPR Generation**: Using this elaborated profile as a high-quality prompt, the AI then generates a complete, multi-section Detailed Project Report, including financial projections and a SWOT analysis.
*   **Comprehensive Output**: The final DPR is a structured document ready for review by banks and investors, covering everything from the executive summary to risk assessment.

### 4. Launchpad & Growth Hub

This section provides resources and community connections to help you launch and grow your business.

*   **MSME Marketplace**: A community hub where MSMEs can list their services. Other users can search this marketplace to find and connect with local businesses for services like digital marketing, accounting, etc. MSME users can publish their own profiles to be discovered.
*   **Resource Center**:
    *   **Government Schemes**: An explorable list of key Indian government schemes (like Startup India, MUDRA, CGTMSE) with descriptions and links.
    *   **Startup Hubs**: Information on major startup ecosystems in India (Bengaluru, Delhi-NCR, etc.).
    *   **Entrepreneurial Journey**: A step-by-step guide walking you through the typical phases of launching a business, from idea validation to marketing and growth.

### 5. Profile & Authentication

*   **Secure Authentication**: User accounts are securely managed through Firebase Authentication, supporting email/password signup.
*   **User Profiles**: Users can manage their profile information. Users who sign up as an MSME can add their business details (name, service, location, contact) which will be listed in the MSME Marketplace.
